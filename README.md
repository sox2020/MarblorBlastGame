# MarblorBlastUnity

This project originally started to see how easy it was to programme Marble Blast (TODO add link).
Yes, it was always supposed to be a cheap remake-like game. But throughout development we came up with all sorts of improvements which could be added to make the game even better. Some ideas include:
- multiplayer
- better graphics
- more powerups
